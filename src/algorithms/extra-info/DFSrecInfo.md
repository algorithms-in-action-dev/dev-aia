## Exercises/Exploration

For Graph 2 can you find a combination of start and end nodes so the path
found includes all nodes in the graph?

The (implicit) stack shown only includes values for **n** and **p**.
In an actual implemenetation the other argument, **G**, would also
generally be on the stack.  What additional value(s) would also be on
the stack?

Given a graph with **N** nodes, what is the maximum height of the stack?

Compare and contrast this DFS coding with the AIA iterative version of
DFS (which has more exercises/exploration).

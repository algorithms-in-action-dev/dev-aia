## Exercises/Exploration



Compare lnsertion Sort with Merge Sort.

	-Why is lnsertion Sort often preferred for very small subarrays inside Merge Sort implementations?

	-How does the asymptotic complexity differ between the two?



Try tracing lnsertion Sort on an array of size 6-8 that is reverse-sorted.

	-How many shifts (element moves) are required in total?

	-How does this compare to the number of comparisons?

Think about the adaptiveness of insertion Sort.

	-Why does Insertion Sort work particularly well on nearly sorted arrays?

	-Can you identify a real-world dataset where this property would be beneficial?

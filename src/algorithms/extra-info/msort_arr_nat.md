## Exercises/Exploration

Compare and contrast the sequence of merge operations performed by
bottom-up and natural merge sort when a) the input is reverse-sorted and
b) the input is sorted.

This version of merge sort adapts well to partially sorted input. Can
you come up with a version of merge sort that adapts well to both
partially sorted and partially reverse-sorted input?

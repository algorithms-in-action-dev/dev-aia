## Exercises/Exploration

Compare and contrast Dijkstra's algorithm with BFS in the case that all
edges are the same length (edit the "SET EDGES/WEIGHTS" box to change
weights and ensure "Weights" is set to "As input"; run BFS with the
same graph).

Compare and contrast Dijkstra's algorithm with Prim's algorithm for
computing minimal spanning trees. If there are no end nodes specified,
what is the key difference between these two algorithms?

In AIA, the coding of various graph algorithms is designed to show
their similarity. Iterative DFS, breadth first search, Dijkstra's
shortest path algorithm, heuristic search and Prim's minimal spanning
tree algorithm all have *identical* top-level pseudocode - check it out!
Can you re-write the code for this and/or for other algorithms to make
it as simple as possible, rather than emphasising similarity?

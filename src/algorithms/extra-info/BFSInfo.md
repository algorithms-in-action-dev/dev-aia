## Exercises/Exploration

Compare and contrast the use of the queue of nodes in BFS with the stack
in iterative DFS.

In AIA, the coding of various graph algorithms is designed to show
their similarity. Iterative DFS, breadth first search, Dijkstra's
shortest path algorithm, heuristic search and Prim's minimal spanning
tree algorithm all have *identical* top-level pseudocode - check it out!
Can you re-write the code for this and/or for other algorithms to make
it as simple as possible, rather than emphasising similarity?

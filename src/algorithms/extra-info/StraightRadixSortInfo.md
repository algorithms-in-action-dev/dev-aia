## Exercises/Exploration

In *counting sort*, temporary array **B** is filled by scanning array
**A** from right to left. If it was scanned from left to right, array
**B** would still end up sorted on the digit in question.  What would
the affect be on the radix sorting if left to right scanning was used?

Look up how sorting punched cards has been done historically. Card
sorting machines used LSD radix sorting! How could you sort a deck of
playing cards using LSD radix sorting?

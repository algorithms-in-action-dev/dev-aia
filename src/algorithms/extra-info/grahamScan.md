## Exercises/Exploration

How could the coding be changed so it returned all points on the hull
(including points on edges that are not on vertices).

What would happen in the Graham Scan algorithm if colinear points were not
dealt with carefully in the sorting phase?

Graham scan is often described as using a stack for the partially
constructed null. Compare a stack-based coding with the AIA coding.
Do these codings really only use stack operations (push, pop, top and
emptyStack)?

Look up other efficient convex hull algorithms and find out about the
many different convex hull algorithms invented over the years.

\\Note{  REAL specification of AVL tree insertion and search
XXX Note: has undergone significant restructure and bookmarks have not been
renamed according to new structure
\\Note}

\\Note{  modified from BST - best check actual running BST Real code for
search and use that  XXX still needs unification with BST

Terminology (changed, might change again but this looks OK I reckon)
XXX should change BST (et al?) so it is consistent
We brush over the fact that pointers are used and use record notation
"." where C "->" would be used (implicit dereference of pointer).
t <- t.left etc is the most dubious looking code if we think of records
and not pointers.
Basically t = Empty or, otherwise, t.key, t.left and t.right exist (we
don't explicitly use t.height in the code but could). Creating a new
singleton tree is done in a single step.

consistent
as possible with BST

Main
\\Note{
  This is recursive, with most of the work done as we return back up from
  recursive calls. This should be visualised in some way. Perhaps
  colouring nodes on the way down and removing the colour on the way
  back up is sufficient - there is only one path back up to the root.
  The "current" node should certainly be highlighted in some way also.
